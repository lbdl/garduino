The base code for the garduino (no relation to the MAKE project) of a garden monitoring and automation project. The base level of the kernel (which should evolve to be a real kernel !)works using the very basic transducers that I used. The circuit diagrams for the (rubbish) transducers will be added later. In priciple all is okay. The electronics need a LOT of work. The makefile is auto generated by the ATMEL avr ide http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=2725, which is no longer used ergo this needs updating so don't expect this to build for you at first go, this will be fixed shortly. This is now aimed at working with Nanode available through http://wiki.hackspace.org.uk/wiki/Project:Ethernet_Arduino/Nanode/Bare_board_waiting_list#Bare_board_waiting_list
